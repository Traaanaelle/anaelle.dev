- Resolve glitches and abnormalities that affect visual effects, excluding intentional ones.


UI/UX:

- Optimize padding specifically for mobile devices and enhance the overall layout.
- Adjust element alignment to achieve a balanced and visually appealing design.
- Increase the size of certain elements to improve their visibility on PCs.
- Enhance responsiveness for various screen sizes.
- Ensure compliance with HTML5 standards to ensure compatibility and functionality.
- If possible, follow Material You (or Theming) guidelines.
- Add flag buttons to switch between different languages (French, US English, British, German, Ch'ti, Breton, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Dutch, etc.), with anthem playback on hover (for PC).


Project Organization and Code Quality:

- Streamline the codebase by eliminating redundant segments.
- Reorganize the GitHub project structure to enhance accessibility and navigation.


Features:

- Include href links to provide additional information about the ingredients.
- Enhance glitch effects to create a more visually impactful experience.
- Integrate Text-to-Speech functionality to enable audio content.


Easter Egg:

- Incorporate a clickable Trans flag with a blåhaj pic that redirects to blahaj.app.
- Embed hidden href links for redirection, such as to a PayPal account or other relevant destinations.
- Include a fake "AI-powered" chatbot.
- Implement a hidden functionality that responds to the Konami code as an Easter egg.
- Provide a raining strawberry background exclusively for Twitch subscribers (requires implementing Twitch account connection and verification of user subscription (not just following) to the ImNotStrawberry channel); ensure compliance with RGPD and other regulations.
- Add a cookies slider, with an accompanying effect related to cookies (biscuits) when enabled.
